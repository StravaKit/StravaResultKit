## Contributions

Assistance with adding new functionality, fixing a bug or reporting a bug is welcome. For new functionality you can browse the `To Do List` for missing features and once you've decided what you'd like to add you can create a new issue to let others know you are going to be preparing an update. Fork the repository, prepare your update with tests and submit a `Pull Request`. For bugs, if you plan on fixing them yourself, please also fork the repository, include tests and submit a `Pull Request`. If you've discovered a bug please create a new issue and label it as a bug. It is possible the issue has already been logged so look before adding a new issue.

If there is a feature that you feel is important and would like it implemented sooner you can create an issue and invite others to comment on it and use the reactions feature to indicate that they also are interested in that feature. The feature requests with more positive reactions will get priority.
